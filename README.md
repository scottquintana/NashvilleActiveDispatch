# NashvilleActiveDispatch

Active Dispatch connects you to the Metro Nashville Police Department via their public API and displays all active police calls. The active calls are viewable in a list and via a map view. The individual incidents are assigned a color, depending on their category and threat level. When using the map view, clicking on the individual incidents offers a specific location and more information. Active Dispatch utilizes UIKit, however, the inspiration came through some recent SwiftUI projects (programmatic UI, gradients, reactive color changes, and the MVVM architecture).
